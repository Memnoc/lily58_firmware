# Responsive Bongo Cat layout for Lily58 :drum: :smile_cat:

I was looking for a cute bongocat animatoion for my Lily58 board. I have found several in the QMK repo but none to my liking and especially with via support.

I have finally found an implementation that worked correctly, so I have added VIA support to it.


Strongly inspired by this implementation:![lily58_bongocat](https://github.com/Rwarcards762/lily58_bongocat)
